<h1> The creed is important because it is the one thing that will are suppose to memorize throughout the program and that will help us succeed throughout the program . The leadership creed could change our way of thinking as what the 7th creed says " 
I believe nothing is hard just a lot of work " and this creed is very important as pretty much 
it is telling us not to think that just cause something is hard it is going to stop us from moving foward. 
The creed will also help us in how to become better as young males and how we could be leaders in our society .

<h2> Well I recieved INFG which was 28% Introvert , 31% iNtuitive , Feeling (28%) , Judging (34%) which I believe is pretty accurate is I say so myself .
What was surprising is how accurate the test was but I believe that it was a little unaccurate on the (28%) Introvert I believe that I may have started off shy but now I am starting to become more talkative and being less shy during class . 
I believe that when I get older I will do the test again to see how my personality has changed. I also think that once I finish the program my results would be changed .
